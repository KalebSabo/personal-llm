# personal-llm
Exploration of LLMs. Attempting to create a personal open-source LLM for fun
Beginnning with a basic build, then moving into more advanced features i.e. see below


Plans (if all goes well):
- heat exchanger modeling/suggestions based on experimental data (utilize tech data reference)
- Reactions with a picture (model after Grok companions)
- Utilize AWS resources (Connect to a personal cloud of services)
